A data analysis of various features that can affect the sales of the product and used machine learning techniques to predict future prices of 45 departmental stores.
identifying the right variables on which the analysis could be conducted
In this project, we conducted multiple linear regression to predict the future sales. There were
several different factors that we analyzed in our regression model starting with a full model with
all the variables and then moving towards a reduced model by eliminating insignificant variables.
We used several different exploratory analyses to identify the key variables for our regression
equation such as correlation plots, heatmaps, histograms etc.
